# AssembyProject
Lab 12 for embedded systems
This was a project created for the last lab in my Introduction to Embedded Systems class. It involves an NXP KL46Z micrcontroller controlling a row of LEDs. A single led in the middle was lit, and only a single of the other LEDs were lit. The game would change which LED is lit so that it appeared to be "moving" back and forth. The goal of the game was to match the moving and stationary LED

This involves the creation of UART drivers to give user feedback, GPIO drivers for the pins, and timer drivers to add delays lighting up the LEDs.
